1j8sflb,BEWARE Redshift Serverless + Zero-ETL,"Our RDS database finally grew to the point where our Metabase dashboards were timing out. We considered Snowflake, DataBricks, and Redshift and finally decided to stay within AWS because of familiarity. Low and behold, there is a Serverless option! This made sense for RDS for us, so why not Redshift as well? And hey! There's a Zero-ETL Integration from RDS to Redshift! So easy!

And it is. Too easy. Redshift Serverless defaults to 128 RPUs, which is very expensive. And we found out the hard way that **the Zero-ETL Integration causes Redshift Serverless' query queue to nearly always be active**, because it's constantly shuffling transitions over from RDS. Which means that nice auto-pausing feature in Serverless? Yeah, it almost never pauses. We were spending over $1K/day when our target was to start out around that much per MONTH.

So long story short, we ended up choosing a smallish Redshift on-demand instance that costs around $400/month and it's fine for our small team.

My $0.02 -- **never use Redshift Serverless with Zero-ETL**. Maybe just never use Redshift Serverless, period, unless you're also using Glue or DMS to move data over periodically.",122,47,kangaroogie,2025-03-11 14:46:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j8sflb/beware_redshift_serverless_zeroetl/,False,False,False,False

1j8r9v7,Seeking Advice on Optimizing ETL Pipeline with SQLAlchemy,"Hello, Data Engineering community! I'm seeking advice on my ETL pipeline architecture. I want to make sure I'm heading in the right direction before investing more time into development.

# Current Setup

* SQL-based ETL pipeline with scripts executed via cron scheduler

* Heavy reliance on PostgreSQL materialized views for transformation and data enrichment

* These materialized views pre-compute complex joins and aggregations between tables

* Data volume: Approximately 60 million rows in the main 2 tables that contain spatial data

* Current transformations primarily involve enriching tables with additional fields from other materialized views

# Pain Points

* SQL scripts are becoming difficult to maintain and reason about

* Limited flexibility for handling diverse data sources (currently PostgreSQL, but expecting CSV files and potentially a graph database in the future)

* Poor visibility into processing steps and lack of proper auditing

* No standardized error handling or logging

* Difficult to implement data quality checks

# Proposed Approach

I'm considering a transition to Python-based ETL using SQLAlchemy Core (not ORM) to:

1. Implement proper auditing (tracking data lineage, processing times, etc.)
2. Create a more flexible pipeline that can handle various data sources
3. Standardize the approach for creating new pipelines
4. Improve error handling and logging
5. Apache airflow will be used for orchestration

# Questions

1. Performance Concerns: With datasets of 10s of millions rows, is SQLAlchemy Core a viable alternative to materialized views for transformation logic? Or should I keep the heavy lifting in SQL
2. Pandas Viability: Is Pandas completely off the table for datasets of this size, or are there techniques (chunking, dask, etc.) that make it feasible
3. Best Practices: What are the best practices for implementing auditing and data lineage in an ETL pipeline?
4. Hybrid Approach: Would a hybrid approach work better - keeping some transformations in SQL (views/functions) while handling orchestration and simpler transformations in Python?

# Technical Context

* Database: PostgreSQL (production will include both Oracle and Postgre as sources)

* Infrastructure: On-premises servers

* Current ETL process runs daily

* I come from a Java backend development background with some Python and Pandas experience

* New to formal data engineering but eager to follow best practices

I appreciate any insights, resources, or alternative approaches you might suggest. Thanks in advance for your help!",12,5,I_Bang_Toasters,2025-03-11 13:53:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j8r9v7/seeking_advice_on_optimizing_etl_pipeline_with/,False,False,False,False
1j92x7u,Best Automated Approach for Pulling SharePoint Files into a Data Warehouse Like Snowflake?,"Hey everyone,

At my company different teams across multiple departments are using SharePoint to store and share files. These files are spread across various team folders libraries and sites which makes it tricky to manage and consolidate the data efficiently.

We are using Snowflake as our data warehouse and Power BI along with other BI tools for reporting. Ideally we want to automate getting these SharePoint files into our database so they can be properly used (by this, I mean used downstream in reporting in a centralized fashion).

Some Qs I have:

- What is the best automated approach to do this?

- How do you extract data from multiple SharePoint sites and folders on a schedule?

- Where should the data be centralized before loading it into Snowflake?

- How do you keep everything updated dynamically while ensuring data quality and governance?


If you have set up something similar I would love to hear what worked or did not work for you. Any recommended tools best practices or pitfalls to avoid?

Trying to figure out what the right call is here—or even what’s generally used. I have an AWS-based data platform established that needs orchestration. It implements resource branching—so I have dev, staging, and prod pipelines and lakehouses.

I could create an MWAA environment for every branch, though this is much more expensive (MWAA would become one of my biggest costs). I could also create one environment that works like CI/CD pipelines and simply changes config values based on what branch it’s supposed to be interacting with.

What’s usually the approach you see with implementing MWAA environments? One environment per branch?

Edit: For clarity, I realize my title presents a third scenario that I didn’t bring up in the post body. Altogether these are the options I see:

1j9ajew,production-grade RAG AI locally with rlama v0.1.26,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a cool tool that simplifies the whole RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process! Instead of juggling a bunch of components like document loaders, text splitters, and vector databases, **rlama** streamlines everything into one neat CLI tool. Here’s the rundown:

* **Document Ingestion & Chunking:** It efficiently breaks down your documents.
* **Local Embedding Generation:** Uses local models via Ollama.
* **Hybrid Vector Storage:** Supports both semantic and textual queries.
* **Querying:** Quickly retrieves context to generate accurate, fact-based answers.

This local-first approach means you get better privacy, speed, and ease of management. Thought you might find it as intriguing as I do!

# Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing RAG with rlama

# 1. Installation

Ensure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed. Then, run:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dontizi/rlama/main/install.sh | sh

Verify the installation:

    rlama --version

# 2. Creating a RAG System

Index your documents by creating a RAG store (hybrid vector store):

    rlama rag <model> <rag-name> <folder-path>

For example, using a model like `deepseek-r1:8b`:

    rlama rag deepseek-r1:8b mydocs ./docs

This command:

* Scans your specified folder (recursively) for supported files.
* Converts documents to plain text and splits them into chunks (default: moderate size with overlap).
* Generates embeddings for each chunk using the specified model.
* Stores chunks and metadata in a local hybrid vector store (in `~/.rlama/mydocs`).

# 3. Managing Documents

Keep your index updated:

* **Add Documents:**rlama add-docs mydocs ./new\_docs --exclude-ext=.log
* **List Documents:**rlama list-docs mydocs
* **Inspect Chunks:**rlama list-chunks mydocs --document=filename
* `rlama list-chunks mydocs --document=filename`
* **Update Model:**rlama update-model mydocs <new-model>

# 4. Configuring Chunking and Retrieval

**Chunk Size & Overlap:**  
 Chunks are pieces of text (e.g. \~300–500 tokens) that enable precise retrieval. Smaller chunks yield higher precision; larger ones preserve context. Overlapping (about 10–20% of chunk size) ensures continuity.

**Context Size:**  
 The `--context-size` flag controls how many chunks are retrieved per query (default is 20). For concise queries, 5-10 chunks might be sufficient, while broader questions might require 30 or more. Ensure the total token count (chunks + query) stays within your LLM’s limit.

**Hybrid Retrieval:**  
 While `rlama` primarily uses dense vector search, it stores the original text to support textual queries. This means you get both semantic matching and the ability to reference specific text snippets.

# 5. Running Queries

Launch an interactive session:

    rlama run mydocs --context-size=20

In the session, type your question:

    > How do I install the project?

`rlama`:

1. Converts your question into an embedding.
2. Retrieves the top matching chunks from the hybrid store.
3. Uses the local LLM (via Ollama) to generate an answer using the retrieved context.

You can exit the session by typing `exit`.

# 6. Using the rlama API

Start the API server for programmatic access:

    rlama api --port 11249

Send HTTP queries:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:11249/rag \
      -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
      -d '{
            ""rag_name"": ""mydocs"",
            ""prompt"": ""How do I install the project?"",
            ""context_size"": 20
          }'

The API returns a JSON response with the generated answer and diagnostic details.

# Recent Enhancements and Tests

# EnhancedHybridStore

* **Improved Document Management:** Replaces the traditional vector store.
* **Hybrid Searches:** Supports both vector embeddings and textual queries.
* **Simplified Retrieval:** Quickly finds relevant documents based on user input.

# Document Struct Update

* **Metadata Field:** Now each document chunk includes a `Metadata` field for extra context, enhancing retrieval accuracy.

# RagSystem Upgrade

* **Hybrid Store Integration:** All documents are now fully indexed and retrievable, resolving previous limitations.

# Router Retrieval Testing

I compared the new version with v0.1.25 using `deepseek-r1:8b` with the prompt:

>*“list me all the routers in the code”*  
 (as simple and general as possible to verify accurate retrieval)

* **Published Version on GitHub:**  **Answer:** The code contains at least one router, `CoursRouter`, which is responsible for course-related routes. Additional routers for authentication and other functionalities may also exist.  *(Source: src/routes/coursRouter.ts)*
* **New Version:**  **Answer:** There are four routers: `sgaRouter`, `coursRouter`, `questionsRouter`, and `devoirsRouter`.  *(Source: src/routes/sgaRouter.ts)*

# Optimizations and Performance Tuning

**Retrieval Speed:**

* Adjust `context_size` to balance speed and accuracy.
* Use smaller models for faster embedding, or a dedicated embedding model if needed.
* Exclude irrelevant files during indexing to keep the index lean.

**Retrieval Accuracy:**

* Fine-tune chunk size and overlap. Moderate sizes (300–500 tokens) with 10–20% overlap work well.
* Use the best-suited model for your data; switch models easily with `rlama update-model`.
* Experiment with prompt tweaks if the LLM occasionally produces off-topic answers.

**Local Performance:**

* Ensure your hardware (RAM/CPU/GPU) is sufficient for the chosen model.
* Leverage SSDs for faster storage and multithreading for improved inference.
* For batch queries, use the persistent API mode rather than restarting CLI sessions.

# Next Steps

* **Optimize Chunking:** Focus on enhancing the chunking process to achieve an optimal RAG, even when using small models.
* **Monitor Performance:** Continue testing with different models and configurations to find the best balance for your data and hardware.
* **Explore Future Features:** Stay tuned for upcoming hybrid retrieval enhancements and adaptive chunking features.

# Conclusion

`rlama` simplifies building local RAG systems with a focus on confidentiality, performance, and ease of use. Whether you’re using a small LLM for quick responses or a larger one for in-depth analysis, `rlama` offers a powerful, flexible solution. With its enhanced hybrid store, improved document metadata, and upgraded RagSystem, it’s now even better at retrieving and presenting accurate answers from your data. Happy indexing and querying!

1j8to8h,Critique my data platform recommendation for analytics team,"I’m tasked with improving the data platform for our small analytics team (20+6 analysts and 2 data scientists) within the company. Currently, we aggregate real-time data from small XML files into a large flat table with a massive number of columns for a single transaction. The XMLs contain all the relevant details of each transaction, and we break them into logical chunks before consolidating everything into one flat table, which is stored in Oracle. We have some dimensions table such as calendar, ZIPCode, Client.

Additionally, the XML and parsed data is stored in on-prem Hadoop storage, which then loads into Oracle every hour.

# Current Problems:

1. **Data Unmanageability**: The sheer size of the data makes it unmanageable. We can only store 1 year of data in the flat table; older partitions are moved into archive tables.
2. **Query Performance**: Most analysis focuses on recent data, so at least the queries on this subset of data are somewhat manageable.
3. **Data Duplication**: Large volumes of data are being dumped onto laptops and VMs for analysis, which is inefficient.
4. **Slow Dashboards**: Tableau dashboards that directly use Oracle are slow to refresh.
5. **Data Science Workflow**: Data scientists run queries and Python code on large VMs to churn through models, but the setup is less efficient.

# Current Workflow:

1. Pull data using SQLs and then use Tableau and Excel for analysis.
2. Some Tableau dashboards are connected to Oracle, leading to long refresh times.
3. Some SQL queries are executed daily/weekly on a VM to generate data dumps, which are then consumed by Tableau or Excel.
4. Data scientists run queries and Python code on large VMs to build models.
5. We have around 2 data scientists, 6 data analysts and around 20 operational analysts.
6. Skillset: data scientists are python and sql savvy. And analysts are comfortable on SQL.

# Proposed Solution:

**Phase 1:**

1. **Copy Data to S3**: Move the raw text files into **Amazon S3**.
2. **Hourly Glue Job**: Create an hourly **AWS Glue** job to read the S3 files and convert them into **Parquet** format, partitioned by **YYYY-MM-DD HH**.
3. **Load Data into Snowflake**: Use **Snowpipe** or an **AWS Lambda** job to automatically copy the Parquet files into a single large table (`main.OBT`) in **Snowflake**, within `schemaA`.
4. Copy dimension tables from oracle to snowflake once a day.
5. **Analyst Querying**: Analysts will create queries to read from `main.OBT` and can write their results to smaller tables in a separate **analyst schema**. Queries can be orchestrated with **Airflow MWAA**.
6. **Data Science Workflow**: Parquet files can be read by the data science team either by continuing to use VMs or transitioning to **Snowpark** for more integrated processing

**Phase 2:**

1. **Copy XMLs to S3**: Move the raw XML files to **S3**.
2. **Parse XMLs with Glue**: Create **AWS Glue** ETL jobs to parse the XML files into smaller **Parquet** files.
3. **Load Data into Snowflake**: Load the smaller **Parquet** files into **Snowflake** tables.
4. **Combine into Main Table**: Combine the smaller tables into the `main.OBT` table for easy access by analysts.

**Phase 3:**

1. **Create Views & Aggregated Tables**: For common use cases, create **views**, **materialized views**, and **aggregated tables** on top of `main.OBT`.
2. **Analyst Schema**: Analysts will use their schema to build the data they need, and if certain tables or views prove valuable, they can be incorporated into the **main schema**. The advantage to promote tables into main schema would be data quality checks and data engineers would own maintaining the tables going forward.
3. Retire the old jobs that build Dimension tables and build new jobs on cloud.

1j8mlab,Optimizing Flink to Process Time-Series Data,"Hi all. I have a Kafka stream that produces around 5 million records per minute and has 50 partitions, Each Kafka record, once deserialized is a json record, where the values for keys 'a','b', and 'c' rpepresent the unique machine for the time series data, and value of key 'data\_value' represent the float value of the record.  All the records in this stream are coming in order. I am using PyFlink to compute specific 30-second aggregations on certain machines within my.

I also have another config kafka stream, where each element in the stream represents the latest machines to monitor. I join this stream with my time-series kafka stream using a broadcast process operator, and filter down records from my raw time-series kafka stream to only ones from relevant machines in the config kafka stream. 

Once I filter down my records, I then key my filtered stream by machine (keys 'a','b', and 'c'  for each record), and call my Keyed Process Operator. In my Process function, I trigger a timer event in 30 seconds once the first record is received and then append all the subsequent  time-series values in my process value state (I set it up as list). Once the timer is triggered, I compute multiple aggregation functions on the time-series values in my value state.

I'm facing a lot of latency issues with the way I have currently structured my PyFlink job.  I currently have 85 threads, with 5 threads per task manager, and each task manager using 2 CPU and 4 GB RAM. This works fine when in my config kafka stream has very few machines, and I filter my raw Kafka stream from 5 million per minute to 70k records per minute. However, when more machines get added to my config Kafka stream, and I start filtering less records, the latency really starts to pile up, to the point where the event\_time and processing\_time of my records are almost hours apart after running for a few hours even close. My theory is it's due to keying my filtered stream since I've heard that can be expensive.

  
I'm wondering if there is any chances for optimizing my PyFlink pipeline, since I've heard Flink should be able to handle way more than 5 million records per minute. In an ideal world, even if no records are filtered from my raw time-series kafka stream, I want my PyFlink pipeline to still be able to process all these records without huge amounts of latency piling up, and without having to explode the resources. 

In short, the steps in my Flink pipeline after receiving the raw Kafka stream are:

* Deserialize record
* Join and filter  on Config Kafka Stream using Broadcast Process Operator
* Key by fields 'a','b', and 'c' and call Process Function to execute aggregation in 30 seconds

Is there any options for optimization in the steps in my pipeline to mitigate latency, without having to blow up resources. Thanks.

1j9af4c,De on an AI team,Hello everyone! I’m a recent new grad who secured a job at big tech company as DE. I was told my team works primarily on recommendation systems and that I’ll be using a bit of PyTorch aswell as some loss bucket analysis. I was wondering if anyone could give me anymore insights on what I should expect or resources to read up on.

1j8zo7x,Help needed for Machine Learning Dagster use-case,"I am trying a PoC with Dagster where I would use it for Computer vision Data pipeline. If it works fine, we will extend its use cases, but currently I need the best way to utilise dagster for my use-case. 

A simplified version of use-case would be, where I have some annotated Object detection data in some standardized format. That is I would have one directory containing images and one directory containing annotated bounding box information in some format. So the next step might just be changing the format and dumping the data to a new directory.

So essentially it's just Format A --> Format B where each file from source directory is processed and stored to destination directory.
But mainly everytime someone dumps a file to Source Directory the processed file in directory B should be materialized. I would like dagster to list all the successful and failed files so that I can backfill them later.

My question how to best design this with Dagster concepts. From what I have read is the best way might be to use Partitioned Asset, especially the Dynamic ones. They seem perfect but the only issue seems the soft limit of 25000, since my use case can contain lakhs of files which might be dumped in source directory at any moment. If Partitioned assets are the best solution how to scale them beyond the 25000 limit",2,1,Quicksilver466,2025-03-11 19:44:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j8zo7x/help_needed_for_machine_learning_dagster_usecase/,False,False,False,False

1j95x5z,¿Cómo elegir tu primera empresa siendo Ingeniero Junior?,"Buenos días a todos!

Estoy terminando el máster en Big Data & Ingeniería de Datos, también ya he hecho una carrera de Ingeniería Informática. Y ahora me interesa hacer mis prácticas del máster o ya conseguir mi primer trabajo. Pero tengo una duda, siendo perfil Junior...cómo puedo empezar a elegir mi primera empresa? He leído por ahí de que no recomiendan empezar por una consultoría, y yo es que ya me he postulado a una consultora  IT(mediana) y me han dicho que he quedado como una de las tres finalistas para trabajar, pero luego otra empresa me ha contactado y es una empresa grande de ingeniería que ya anteriormente hice mis prácticas para el grado de Ing. Informática, pero la sede en donde lo hice el equipo de IT sólo eran 2. Así que ahora he postulado al de Barcelona ya que ahí el equipo de Datos en IT es mucho más grande, pero me han dicho que no hay vacantes para trabajador pero podrían darme para prácticas. Entonces yo siendo junior en Ingeniería de Datos, ¿debo decidirme por una consultora de tecnología o por la otra empresa de Ingeniería que es reconocida internacionalmente aunque no se dedican principalmente al sector IT? Probablemente haría prácticas ahí como 4 o 5 meses.

No sé si darle prioridad para mi curriculum y ya luego de terminar mis prácticas postular para una mejor empresa IT, o irme directo a la consultoría y ya trabajar.

¿Cómo empezaron ustedes?

Ando un poco perdida sobre qué debo valorar mejor las condiciones para el inicio de mi vida profesional.

Cualquier opinión sería de ayuda.

1j96dio,New to Azure - Not sure what do I do?,"I work as a data analyst and use powerbi to import transform clean and report. I have been able to create pipelines in powerbi and provide close to real time data by using refreh option. We never had a database. Only google sheet (data source) and powerbi (analytics)

I asked my ceo for a database to be able to create a system that stores data and also provide real time analyses. Meaning when a value changes in the google sheet, it should be right away updated in the powerbi. I only had some basic understanding of ETL and thats it

Now the IT team were able to get a subscription for me that is $300 per month. It has azure database with sql server and azure data factory and sent me this email (please see below). I was not given login instructions as I already can log in but when I click databases, it asks me to select subscription (please see below)

Im hesitant to ask them for stupid questions. Can someone guide me? Or provide a video tutorial.

1j8vtwx,Stuck in TCS for ninja profile,"Hey everyone, I recently joined TCS through the Ninja profile and was allocated to a Data Engineering (DE) project in a client-facing role. The role seems great — the client is good, it is also WFH and the work is interesting. Right now, I'm starting as a tester since I don't have much experience with DE yet, but I believe if I stay here for 2-3 years, I can learn a lot and build valuable skills.

However, the main concern for me is the salary — it's 3.36 LPA, which is honestly a bit discouraging. Before joining TCS, I was an intern at a small startup, working with Angular and Spring Boot. I joined TCS primarily for the job security, and I also expected to have a lot of free time here. But it seems like life has different plans for me.

I also know React, Node.js, and DSA, though I need to refresh my skills in these areas. If I decide to switch to a full-stack developer role, I think I could make that transition in 7-8 months. But the DE role is a bigger challenge since it's not easy for freshers to get into this field maybe I can jump to a goof package.
