1jazwyy,"If we already have a data warehouse, why was the term data lake invented? Why not ‘data storeroom’ or ‘data backyard’? What’s with the aquatic theme?","I’m trying to wrap my head around why the term *data lake* became the go-to name for modern data storage systems when we already had the concept of a *data warehouse*.

1. Lakes = ‘natural’ (raw data) vs. Warehouses = ‘manufactured’ (processed data).

1jaymc4,Transform raw bucket to organized,"Hi all, I've got my first etl task in my new job.
I am a data analyst who is starting to take on data engineer tasks. So would happy to get any help.


I have a messy bucket in S3(~5TB),
the bucket consists of 3 main folders called Folder1, Folder2, Folder3.
Each main folder is divided by the date of upload to S3, so in each main folder there is a folder for each month, in each month there is one for each day, in each day there is one for each hour. Each file in each hour is a jsonl(raw data). Each json in a jsonl has a game_id.

I want to unite all the json that have the same id from all three main folders into one folder(named by this game_id) that will consist those 3 main folders but only for this game_id. So I will have folder1_i, folder2_i, folder3_i inside a folder named i for game_id=i.
Then manipulate the data for each game by those 3 main folders(join data, filter, aggregate, etc...)


The same game_id could be in some different files across few folders(game that lasts 1+ hour-so different hour folder, or stared very late-so different day folder)
But mainly 1± hour, 1± day.


It should be noted that new files continue to arrive to this raw s3.( So need to do this task roughly every day)


What are the most recommended tools for performing this task (in terms of scalability, cost, etc..)
I came across many tools and didn't know which one to choose(aws glue, aws emr, dbt, ...)

EDIT:
The final organized s3 bucket is not necessary,
I just want a comfortable query-able destination.
So maybe s3->redshift->dbt?

1jbcvjb,Tools for file movement,"Looking to hear from others in the banking/finance industry. We have hundreds of partners/vendors and move tens of thousands of files (mainly csv, cobol and json) all through sftp daily.

As of today we are using an on prem moveit server for most of these, which manages credentials and keys decently but has a meh ui. But we are moving away from on prem and are looking towards a cloud native solution.

Last year we started to dabble with azure data factory copy functions, since we could use the copy function then trigger databricks notebooks (or vice versa) for ingestion/extraction. however, due to orchestration costs, execution speed, and limitations with key/credential management, we’d like to find something else.

I know that ADF and databricks can pair with key vault, and can handle encryption/decryption via python, but they run slower as they have to spin up job compute or orchestrate/queue the job where moveit can just run. If I have to loop through and copy 10 files that get pgp encrypted first, what takes moveit 30-60 seconds takes ADF and databricks 15 mins, which at our daily volume is not acceptable. 

Lastly, our data engineers are only responsible for extracting a file from databricks to adls, or ingesting to databricks from adls not actually moving it to its final destination, while a sister team is responsible for moving the file from/to adls (this is not their main function, but they are responsible for it). Most members of this team don’t have python/coding experience, so the low/no code part of moveit works well.

In my opinion, this arrangement of responsibilities isn’t the best, but it’s not going to change anytime soon, so what are some possible solutions for file movement orchestration that can integrate with adls storage accounts/file shares, maybe manage credentials/interact with key vault, and can orchestrate jobs in a low/no code fashion

1jb7p01,How to maintain Custom Metrics and Logging in Databricks,"Hello everyone,

**Environment:** Databricks Notebook running on a Databricks Cluster  
**Application:**  
A non-Spark Python application that traverses a Databricks volume directory containing multiple zip files, extracts and processes them using a ThreadPool with several workers.

**Problem:**  
I need to track and maintain counters/metrics for each run, such as:

* `no_of_files_found_in_current_run`
* `no_of_files_successfully_processed`
* `no_of_files_failed`
* `no_of_files_failed_due_to_reason_1`, etc.

Additionally, I want to log detailed errors for failed extractions. One simple solution would be to maintain these counters as Python variables and then store them in a Delta table at the end. However, since the extraction process isn’t atomic, if 50 out of 100 zip files are processed and a failure occurs, the counters won’t be persisted in the table because the update happens in the final step. In the case of a retry, these 50 processed files won’t be reflected in the counters. Continuously updating the counters in the Delta table doesn’t seem like the best approach.

The same issue arises with logging. I’ve defined a custom logger using Python’s logging module, but since the logs are stored in the Databricks volume (which ultimately syncs with Azure Blob storage), new log entries aren’t being appended. If I log on the driver VM, the log file needs to be copied to Azure Blob at the end, but in case of failure, this step might not happen, causing the logs to be lost. One potential solution is to use Spark’s built-in logger and log directly to the driver’s logs. However, I’m looking for suggestions on whether there’s a better way to approach this problem.

  
How will you approach this problem, Thanks in Advance!",2,2,Uds0128,2025-03-14 16:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jb7p01/how_to_maintain_custom_metrics_and_logging_in/,False,False,False,False

And I really appreciate that from her. But at the same time I get disheartened by some things she says.🧿🧿

Like last time I told her that I got really excited when I got an opportunity from **a reputable digital media company(it owns big brands like people magazine, based in NYC)** and she told me those roles are mostly for people who come from generational wealth. I felt disheartened. Because I actually want to work in Consumer Insights but not in the CPG domain. More like media and tech. Like a top tier company like a FAANG, or something else. But since she’s said that I’ve been feeling a bit bummed out. 

She also told me that I will have to make sacrifices in my career and told me that her first job was very low paying. But she took the job for the experience and she worked long hours etc. but she said she did it to have the job she has now. But the thing is, I don’t want her job. As I don’t want to work in pure marketing like CPG. I’m glad shes trying to help me. I don’t have real corporate work experience but I am trying to get some through courses and projects. 

My concern is, is this woman of any use to me or no? Is going through sample/masked CPG consumer insights data going to help me in any way? I’m trying to learn some IT stuff as well to get into a data analytics/tech role, and have some experience working for an IT consulting startup, class work and volunteer experience.
